# Kevin Tran's Portfolio

I am an oversea student from VietNam, I came to the US 5 years ago. My actual name is Dinh Thien Tu Tran, I go by Kevin as it is easier for people to refer. I chose to take this class because a friend of mine recommended. He told me to take this class with Software Engineering as I they are related in a way. Also, these 2 classes will provide me with actual real-life experience in the industry.
